# friction
This code(main.py) calculates the friction coefficinet by the center of mass daynamics in the nuclear quasi-fission.
*.cmsep.txt in dataset folder is the center of mass dynamics in the nuclear quasi-fission,
while *.out in dataset folder is the picture of the nuclear quasi-fission in each time.
In order to calculate friciton coefficient, the start time and end time of quasi-fission is needed and they are identified by the picture in *.out file.
By the center of mass dynamics data in the start time and end time, the friciton coefficient is calculated. 
By the following command, the calcuation is performed.
The calculation result is summarized in summary_detail.txt and summary.csv.
(summary_detail.txt is the information check the calculation process of the summary.csv.)
